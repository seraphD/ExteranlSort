# ExternalSort

Sorting algorithms practicing project.

# Overview

Using sorting algorithms to sort files to reduce disk accessing.

# Algorithms

## Heap sort / replacement selection

Using a 8 blocks sized memory block to implement this algorithm. Consider the memory array as a heap.

## Merge sort / multiway merge

The previous will produce "run". A run is a 8 blocks long sorted keys and values. Using merge sort to merge runs into one file
